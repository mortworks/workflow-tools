# global-templates.yaml
# ----------------------
# These are blog-agnostic, reusable templates designed for use in any Hugo site.
# 
# The entries below can be used by `new.sh` as universal scaffolds, and are 
# especially useful when creating posts that are either:
#   - simple Markdown-only ("blank"), or
#   - hand-tooled composite posts ("custom")
# 
# These global templates should NOT be edited on a per-blog basis. 
# Blog-specific templates belong in <blog>/data/templates.yaml.

blank:
  layout: post
  draft: true
  # structure: []  # Uncomment and edit to activate composite rendering
  anchors: []
  note: "# This is a plain Markdown post. To override and use blocks, uncomment 'structure'."

custom:
  layout: post
  draft: true
  structure:
    - type: text
      ref: introduction
    - type: scaffold
      ref: sample-scaffold
    - type: text
      ref: conclusion
  anchors:
    - introduction
    - conclusion
  note: |
    # This is a scaffold-ready post.
    # You can edit the structure manually or copy/paste from other posts.
    # Useful for early prototyping or mixing components directly.
